## Project description

This folder will contain the code used to analyse the DASS-21 questionnaire for the upcoming article *The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) among two Finnish occupational cohorts: Validation, Normative Data, and Pschometric Properties* (Vähäsarja et al., 2024?). The data were collected as a part of the Helsinki Health Study (helsinki.fi/hhs), an epidemiological study started in 2000.

## What is DASS?

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-42) is a public domain questionnaire intended to measure and differentiate affective symptoms. The shortened DASS-21 has later become popular, particularly for research. It has appeared in thousands of original research articles and been translated to more than forty languages.

Questionnaire data is tricky. We investigated whether or not the new Finnish translation works among Finns as it is expected to. If the factor structure or reported symptoms significantly deviated from English-speaking populations, the DASS-21 could not have been employed.
